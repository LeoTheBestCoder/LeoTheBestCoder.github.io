[{"content":"I come from Taichung, a heartwarming city in central Taiwan.\nI spent my high school years in class of math and science gifted students at Taichung Municipal Taichung Second Senior High School, during which I made many good friends and obtained countless amazing memories.\nAt 2018 July, I finished my ultimate mission in high school — Advanced Subjects Test — and was luckily admitted to Department of Electrical Engineering in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU EE).\nAfter some semesters, I gradually found that I prefer software courses to hardware ones. Thus, I took some CS-related courses, such as computer architecture, data structure, etc. I also applied for internship as a software engineer at Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Besides, I joined MeiChu Hackathon Competition and won the first place in October, 2020. The sense of achievement gives me the motivation to keep working hard. For details, you can visit my posts.\nMoreover, I joined NTHU EE Camp in July 2019 and 2020, during which I enjoyed a good time and made so many good friends. I am also the activities director of NTHU EE Student Association. Both experiences left a deep imperssion on me.\nLast but not least, I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of pop band — Mayday. Their music not only provides me an outlet for my tension but encourages me all the time so that I can endure my pressure. How lucky am I to live in the same era with Mayday!\n","permalink":"https://LeoTheBestCoder.github.io/posts/intro/","summary":"I come from Taichung, a heartwarming city in central Taiwan.\nI spent my high school years in class of math and science gifted students at Taichung Municipal Taichung Second Senior High School, during which I made many good friends and obtained countless amazing memories.\nAt 2018 July, I finished my ultimate mission in high school — Advanced Subjects Test — and was luckily admitted to Department of Electrical Engineering in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU EE).","title":"Self Introduction"},{"content":"hey dude\n","permalink":"https://LeoTheBestCoder.github.io/posts/meichu/","summary":"hey dude","title":"MeiChu Hackathon 梅竹黑客松"}]
