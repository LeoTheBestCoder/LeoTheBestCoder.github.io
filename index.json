[{"content":"I come from Taichung, a heartwarming city in central Taiwan.\nI spent my high school years in class of math and science gifted students at Taichung Municipal Taichung Second Senior High School, during which I made many good friends and obtained countless amazing memories.\nAt July 2018, I finished my ultimate mission in high school — Advanced Subjects Test — and was luckily admitted to Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU EE).\nAfter some semesters, I gradually found that I prefer software courses to hardware ones. Thus, I took some CS-related courses, such as computer architecture, data structure, etc. I also applied for the internship as a software engineer at Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Besides, I joined MeiChu Hackathon Competition and won the first place in October, 2020. The sense of achievement gives me the motivation to keep working hard. For details, you can visit my posts.\nMoreover, I joined NTHU EE Camp in July 2019 and 2020, during which I enjoyed a good time and made so many good friends. I was also the activities director of NTHU EE Student Association. Both experiences left deep imperssion on me.\nLast but not least, I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of the famous pop band, Mayday. Their music not only provides me an outlet for my tension but encourages me all the time so that I can endure my pressure. How lucky am I to live in the same era with Mayday!\n","permalink":"https://LeoTheBestCoder.github.io/posts/intro/","summary":"I come from Taichung, a heartwarming city in central Taiwan.\nI spent my high school years in class of math and science gifted students at Taichung Municipal Taichung Second Senior High School, during which I made many good friends and obtained countless amazing memories.\nAt July 2018, I finished my ultimate mission in high school — Advanced Subjects Test — and was luckily admitted to Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU EE).","title":"Self Introduction"},{"content":"Date 2020/10/24 (Sat.) - 2020/10/25 (Sun.)\nTopic Logitech International: Ethical gaming world\nDescription There are increasingly more online games in recent years. When playing, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to encounter cheating behaviors that will decrease our will to play. Thus, we want to develop a cheating detection system that can detect unethical actions in online games.\nWays of \u0026ldquo;Cheating\u0026rdquo;  gaming hack AFK (away from keyboard) ask other people to play etc  Solution: Machine Learning We surveyed a paper[1] focusing on remote suspicious mouse intrusion, which gave us some inspiraiton. We believed that when a player cheats in a game, the mouse track must be different. So, we used random forest to train a one-class classifier, excepting the model after training could tell whether the input mouse track comes from the same person. By doing so, no matter the player installs gaming hack or asks his/her friends to play for him/her, our system could always tell us that the behavior was abnormal.

Data Collection and Preprocessing  Game: CS-GO Type: First-person shooter (FPS) game Repository: Link Data recording: Python   Awards Out of hundreds of people, We won the FIRST place of Logitech and the FIRST place in the second round competiting with other champions from other enterprises including LINE and Micron Taiwan.

Therefore, our lab founded CarePLUS Group with the aim to develop a home care system, monitoring the action of the elderly and detect whether they are in danger using computer vision. Besides, the system will remind them to take medicine and do exercise regularly.\nObjective Our goal is to improve the performance of object detection model by finding out frames that are more valuable.Within a limited amount of data, we construct \u0026ldquo;Active Sample\u0026rdquo; algorithm by Active Learning to achieve this goal. Method In addition to original active sample algorithm, we add a threshold for bounding box in order to sample FP (false positive) frames and FN (false negative) frames more precisely.
